## Getting Started

### Adding themes

1. For a new theme, you need to add a new folder in the `public/themes` directory. You need to have the style (
   blueprints) folder downloaded somewhere on your local machine. Then run `create_theme_folders.py` script with the
   path to the style folder as. This will copy the structure and create folder for every blueprint.
2. Read the `rename_screenshots.py` script and run it if necessary to rename the screenshots to be in the format
   `{level?}{front|back}.jpg`.
3. Run `resize_images.py` to make the screenshots be square
4. Run [optimize-images](https://pypi.org/project/optimize-images/) to scale the images down, convert to jpg and
   optimize them:
   ```bash
   optimize-images -ca -fd -q 90 -mw 700 -mh 700 .\public\minecolonies
    ```
5. Run `theme_json_builder.py` to create the main `themes.json`. Add the theme to the file's config object.

> Note: the scripts don't have cli arguments yet, so you need to change the paths in the scripts manually to match your
local setup.
